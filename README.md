# Graph-Routing-Algorithms

This is a program that analyzes the efficiency of hot-potato vs ant-colony graph routing algorithms. This group project was created as an assignment for my _Introduction to Operating Systems_ class at IUPUI. We were tasked with creating a program that utilizes threading to implement the two algorithms so we can determine which algorithm is more efficient in terms of time and number of hops between nodes. The hot-potato algorithm randomly chooses which neighbor node to move to next, while the ant-colony algorithm bases its next destination on probabilities from pheremones from previous "ant trails." Our methods and results are described in much greater details in the _Results_ Microsoft Word document.
